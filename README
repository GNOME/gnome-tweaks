GNOME TWEAK TOOL
----------------
 * The first rule of gnome-tweak-tool is do not talk about gnome-tweak-tool

Running
-------
 * If you wish to run the application uninstalled, execute;

./gnome-tweak-tool [-p /path/to/jhbuild/prefix/]

 * If you wish to install system wide you must

./autogen.sh && make && make install

TODO
----
 * I'm not sure if the TweakGroup layer is necessary, and it makes
   it hard to categorise things. Perhaps go to a named factory approach
 * Do some more things lazily to improve startup speed
