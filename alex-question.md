Hey there! I am really interested in a new feature added to Gnome Tweak Tools. When I have a 2nd monitor attached to my Ubuntu laptop running gnome
when I drag the mouse from one screen to the other, the pointer will stick to the edge of the screen and I have to jerk the mouse to get it to
cross. The screen edges are sticky!

I haven't verified this works yet, but this might be a solution:

Maybe open up issues so I don't have to submit a PR to make a comment? IDK lulz
